LetsFakeNews: a realtime fake-news generator
<br/>
<br/>
This is an interactive multimedia installation for public settings, based upon second-screening via a mobile-first web-app.
<br/>
<br/>
The client's mobile-first web-interface allows a fake-news report to be submitted by first asking for a story and then a title. This second-screen client-service is accessed remotely @ letsfakenews.herokuapp.com
<br/>
<br/>
Displaying fake-news stories must be done on chrome/firefox/opera browsers ONLY in fullscreen.
For clients (password protected), the fullscreen display-service is accessed @ letsfakenews.herokuapp.com/display
